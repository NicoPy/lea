LEA - a Lightweight Editor for Ada
----------------------------------

LEA, a Lightweight Editor for Ada, aims to provide an easy,
script-like, "look & feel" for developing Ada projects of
any size, while enabling access to full-scale development
tools like GNAT.

Platforms supported:

  * Windows
  * Some effort has been made to make LEA cross-UI-toolkits-portable
    without redoing it from scratch on another platform.
    See the LEA_Common package and children.
  
How to build & modify LEA

  * You need the GNAT compiler: http://libre.adacore.com
  * Read the comments in the lea.gpr project file 
      (just open as text file) for further instructions.
